Note in regards to PBBS forwarding:
If you do compressed forwarding with other PBBS systems, insure you flag
your connection so that you do NOT have ANSI turned on for that interface
AND that you disable the escape character. See: man uronode.perms
for the proper flags. This insures that compression will stay enabled
and that a compressed ctrl+t is not sent via compressed ascii codes.
